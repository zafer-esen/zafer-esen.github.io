I am a computer scientist specializing in automated reasoning and formal methods.

I recently completed my PhD at Uppsala University, where my research focused on the formal verification of programs with complex heap-allocated data structures, using techniques in Horn-based model checking and SMT solving.

Prior to my PhD studies, I also worked on designing and implementing embedded systems and mechatronic control systems for over six years in the defense industry.
